Alejandro – Infrastructure & Metrics Architect,"• Define 3–5 security metrics to track (e.g., open security groups, public S3 buckets, CloudTrail status, IAM MFA compliance) • Create CloudWatch Metrics and Logs groups for these",• CloudFormation or Terraform template for CloudWatch Dashboards and metrics • Boto3 scripts to push custom metrics,Architecture diagram + metric collection code + CloudWatch dashboard view
Nicole – Automation & Alert Engineer,• Build the Lambda function that collects data and analyzes thresholds • Integrate EventBridge or CloudWatch Alarms to trigger alerts • Configure SNS notifications (email or Slack),• Lambda (Python/Node.js) code that runs periodically to check metrics • SNS alert workflow • Demo showing alert triggered,Lambda function repo + alert demo screenshots + CloudWatch rule
Kelly – Reporting & Visualization Lead,• Automate daily/weekly summary reports • Store aggregated logs in S3 and generate summary via CloudWatch Insights or Athena • Build final dashboard and slides explaining findings,• Python script that compiles JSON/CSV report and emails via SNS or SES • Final CloudWatch dashboard visuals and slide deck,Summary report JSON + final visuals + slides + metrics table
