### Solution Design Templates

#### Lambda Function Structure (Python)
```python
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    MedTech Security Automation
    Purpose: [Your automation purpose]
    """
    
    # Step 1: Collect security data
    findings = collect_security_data()
    
    # Step 2: Analyze findings
    risks = analyze_findings(findings)
    
    # Step 3: Take action
    if risks:
        respond_to_risks(risks)
    
    # Step 4: Report results
    send_notification(findings, risks)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'findings_count': len(findings)
    }

def collect_security_data():
    # Your security checks here
    pass

def analyze_findings(findings):
    # Risk analysis logic
    pass

def respond_to_risks(risks):
    # Automated response
    pass

def send_notification(findings, risks):
    # SNS/Email notification
    pass
```

#### CloudFormation Structure
```yaml

  SecurityFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: python3.9
      Role: !GetAtt LambdaRole.Arn
      Environment:
        Variables:
          SNS_TOPIC: !Ref AlertTopic

### Architecture Diagram Components

Include these elements:
1. **Trigger** (EventBridge/CloudWatch)
2. **Lambda Function** (center)
3. **AWS Services** (S3, IAM, EC2, etc.)
4. **Data Store** (S3/DynamoDB for results)
5. **Notifications** (SNS/SES)
6. **Monitoring** (CloudWatch)

### Security Checks Examples

```python
# Example: Check for public S3 buckets
def check_public_buckets():
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    public_buckets = []
    
    for bucket in s3.list_buckets()['Buckets']:
        acl = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket=bucket['Name'])
        for grant in acl['Grants']:
            if 'AllUsers' in str(grant):
                public_buckets.append(bucket['Name'])
    
    return public_buckets

# Example: Check for MFA on IAM users
def check_mfa_compliance():
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    non_compliant_users = []
    
    for user in iam.list_users()['Users']:
        mfa_devices = iam.list_mfa_devices(UserName=user['UserName'])
        if not mfa_devices['MFADevices']:
            non_compliant_users.append(user['UserName'])
    
    return non_compliant_users

# Example: Check security group rules
def check_security_groups():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    risky_groups = []
    
    sgs = ec2.describe_security_groups()
    for sg in sgs['SecurityGroups']:
        for rule in sg['IpPermissions']:
            if '0.0.0.0/0' in str(rule):
                risky_groups.append(sg['GroupId'])
    
    return risky_groups
```

### Demo Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Clear scenario setup
- [ ] Input data prepared
- [ ] Expected output defined
- [ ] Screenshots captured
- [ ] Timing rehearsed (5 min max)
- [ ] Backup plan ready

### Value Metrics Examples
- **Time Savings:** Manual check = 2 hours/day → Automated = 0 minutes
- **Coverage:** Manual = 10 resources → Automated = 1000+ resources
- **Response Time:** Manual = 1-2 hours → Automated = < 1 minute
- **Cost:** Lambda execution = ~$5/month vs Manual effort = $4000/month

### Practice Questions to Prepare For
- How did you choose what to automate?
- What's the error handling strategy?
- How does this scale?
- What's the false positive rate?
- How do you update the automation?
- What's the monthly AWS cost?

## Success Criteria

Your presentation should demonstrate:
1. **Clear problem** identification and solution
2. **Sound technical** architecture using AWS services
3. **Practical automation** that provides real value
4. **Security awareness** in the solution design
5. **Professional communication** of technical concepts

Remember: You're presenting a security automation design. Focus on the problem solved, the technical approach, and the value delivered. The demo/walkthrough should clearly show how your automation improves MedTech's security posture.
